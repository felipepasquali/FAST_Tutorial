Tutorial to work and use the software NREL FAST 

This tutorial has the objective to show students how to use the software NREL FAST. The software has now transitioned to a github version and is alternatively called OpenFast. In this tutorial we are working with FAST V8 and with the already compliled version of it. The software can be downloaded from https://nwtc.nrel.gov/FAST8. For the Students of MAE510 - Energy Conversion we will distribute via UBLearns.
