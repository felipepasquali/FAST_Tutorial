Tutorial for software NREL FAST / OpenFAST

Over the past years we have noticed an increasing need for an introductory tutorial for FAST. The students often go the the NREL website, dowload the software, and are unable to move forward. This tutorial has the objective to show students how to get started with the software NREL FAST.  The software has now transitioned to a collaborative version and is alternatively called OpenFast. In this tutorial we are working with the already compiled version of FAST v8.16.  NOTE: For the Students of MAE510 - Energy Conversion we will distribute via UBLearns.The software can be downloaded from https://nwtc.nrel.gov/FAST8. For the later, you will need to register and wait for a period of 2-5 business days to be approved.

NOTE: The tutorial runs from Matlab in a WINDOWS machine. If you are an advanced Mac/Linux user you can skip the installation part and go to https://github.com/openfast and compile your own version of FAST.

How to run this tutorial:

1. Download the repository (or clone the repository if you are familiar with git)
2. Open the file using the Matlab text editor and follow the instructions.
3. Run the "uncommented" lines as you go (one at a time). For that select the whole line and press F9.
